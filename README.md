# This is my Homework 4 Repo for ENVS 193DS

In this assignment, we utilized the data from the "North Temperate Lakes LTER: Fish Lengths and Weights 1981 - current" which can be found in this repo's data folder.

This data set encompasses the fish assemblages of eleven primary lakes in the United States which allowed us to answer the following question: How does fish length predict fish weight for trout perch (across all sample years)?



More data-specific information and methods can be found in the metadata, link: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-ntl.6.34
